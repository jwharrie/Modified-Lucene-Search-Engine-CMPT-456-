For stopwords.txt, place it in the directory /lucene/demo/data.

Also for stopwords.txt, make sure each stopword has its own line. See the attached stopwords.txt file for an example.

The provided files are assumed to be placed in the org.apache.lucene.demo, the same place as IndexFiles.java and SearchFiles.java.

Note that IndexFiles.java is left unedited.

CMPT456Analyzer is used in SearchFiles.java, HtmlIndexFiles.java, SimpleMetrics.java, TFIDFHtmlIndexFiles.java and TFIDFSearchFiles.java.

SimpleMetrics.java assumes only one term will be used per query. Otherwise a document frequency will return but term frequency will be 0.

Also for SimpleMetrics.java, only the document frequency and term frequency will display for each query. No search results will appear.
